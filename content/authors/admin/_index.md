I am an artificial intelligence (AI) PhD candidate at Nanjing University. My goal is to develop techniques necessary for advanced automated systems to verifiably act according to human preferences, even in situations unanticipated by their designer. I am particularly interested in improving methods for robot swarm attacks and defenses, robot visual, and robustness of deep RL.

I work closely with the State Key Laboratory of Intelligent Technology and System, Department of Computer Science and Technology, Tsinghua University. Prior to joining Tsinghua, I had the pleasure of working in the Intelligent Robot Group at the Shenzhen Institute of Artificial Intelligence and robotics. Please see my CV for a more comprehensive list of my prior experience.
